 - Highly motivated Computer Engineering graduate student with expertise in Software Development and Artificial Intelligence. 
 - Skilled in Java, Python, Golang, C# and JavaScript. 
 - Solid research background in backdoor learning, computer vision, and medical image segmentation. I have worked closely with [Dr. Erick Purwanto](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Erick-Purwanto) and [Prof. Jie Zhang](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=NVdWSwoAAAAJ&hl=en) during my undergraduate study.
 - Experienced in full-stack development and interned at Wensi Haihui Information Technology Co., Ltd. 
 - Also a published researcher with strong time management and teamwork skills. 
 - Fluent in English, Mandarin, and Japanese.

My recent research interest includes robust machine learning and backdoor attacks in computer vision.

[Conditional Metadata Embedding Data Preprocessing Method for Semantic Segmentation](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10090205)

- In this paper, we propose a conditional data preprocessing strategy, i.e., Conditional Metadata Embedding (CME) data preprocessing strategy. The CME data preprocessing method will embed conditional information to the training data, which can assist the model to better overcome the differences in the datasets and extract useful feature information in the images.

   - Designed an algorithm uses Salience Metric to evaluate sample feature significance towards backdoor learning process.
   - It is a more data-efficient backdoor attack algorithm to DNN models achieved the same attack success rate with only 38.44% of poisoned samples.
